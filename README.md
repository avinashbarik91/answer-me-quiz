# AnswerMe Quiz

AnswerMe is a Quiz game which uses the Open Trivia Database API to source questions and answers. 
The Open Trivia Database provides a completely free JSON API for use in programming projects. 

Multiple choice questions are displayed out of which user can choose one answer.
The app also uses SQLite to persist user data and scores of users. 

Sound Effects within the game are used with the help of Androidâ€™s MediaPlayer class. ListViews are used to display Categories and High Scores during the gameplay.
Intents are used to pass messages from one activity to another including Parcelable intents. 

The design follows an MVC architecture as the controller logic is totally separate from the view logic. 
The model layer is again in segregated in different directories.

The main game logic follows randomization and both the questions and the answers are randomized.
